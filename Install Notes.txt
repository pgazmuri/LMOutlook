To Install this application:

1. Determine which SharePoint site will host the application, and create a new document library there called "PluginHost"
2. Update the OutlookApp.xml file:
	Find all references to "https://Perkin/" (there should be 5 references)
	Replace with the location of the PluginHost library that you created in step 1.
2.5 Update the Environment.txt file to contain the correct email address for the current environment.
2.9 Remove the AllowFraming Tag from the ASPX files (SharePoint 2010 deployment requires this)
3. Copy the files in this directory to the "PluginHost" library
4. In the same SharePoint site, create a Custom List called "Snippets"
5. Add the following Columns to the Snippets list:
	Category - Choice (as dropdown) with options: "General Content" and "APD Claims Handling" (for now, we will add additional options later as needed)
	Description - Single Line of text
	Content - Enhanced Rich Text, 15 lines for editing, Append Changes:No
	Order - Number, 0 decimal places to show, default value 0
	Subject - Single Line of Text
6. Ensure that end users will have read access to the SharePoint site hosting the application
7. Supply the OutlookApp.xml manifest to Exchange Administrators to deploy the add-in to test users

Note:

In order for the app to load, users must have SSO (single sign on) access to the SHarePoint environment.  
This means that the SharePoint site must be recognized as being in the local intranet zone with NTLM authentication enabled, or is marked as trusted.  
If users are prompted for credentials when accessing SharePoint, this app will not load within outlook.
